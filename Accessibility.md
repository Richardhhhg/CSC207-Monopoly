# Accessibility Report

## Principle 1: Equitable Use
**Current Features:**  
Our program provides a consistent visual interface that all users interact with in the same way, with clear color-coding for property ownership and player identification. The game mechanics are standardized across all players without requiring different interfaces for different abilities.

**Future Improvements:**  
We could implement alternative input methods such as keyboard navigation for users who cannot use a mouse, and provide audio cues or screen reader compatibility for visually impaired users. Text-to-speech functionality could announce game events and current player status.

## Principle 2: Flexibility in Use
**Current Features:**  
Players can choose from different character types with unique abilities, allowing for varied gameplay strategies. The stock market feature provides multiple paths to victory beyond traditional property acquisition. Players can sell properties and stocks at different times during their turns, accommodating different play styles.

**Future Improvements:**  
We could add difficulty settings, customizable game rules (such as adjustable turn limits or starting money), and the ability to save/load games to accommodate users with different time constraints or cognitive processing speeds.

## Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive Use
**Current Features:**  
The interface follows familiar Monopoly conventions with a traditional board layout that users already understand. Clear button labels ("Roll Dice", "End Turn", "Stock Market") and visual feedback through color-coded property ownership make the interface intuitive. The game automatically handles complex calculations like rent payments and stock price updates.

**Future Improvements:**  
We could add tutorials, help tooltips, and context-sensitive guidance to make the game even more accessible to new players. Visual indicators showing available actions during each turn phase would reduce confusion.

## Principle 4: Perceptible Information
**Current Features:**  
The program uses multiple methods to convey information: visual colors for player identification, text labels for all interactive elements, and popup dialogs for important events like property purchases. Different tile types (Go, Property, Stock Market) have distinct visual appearances.

**Future Improvements:**  
We could implement high contrast mode, scalable font sizes, and audio announcements for game events. Visual indicators could be supplemented with text descriptions, and important information could be presented redundantly through multiple sensory channels.

---

## Principle 5: Tolerance for Error
**Current Features:**  
The game prevents invalid moves automatically (e.g., cannot buy properties without sufficient funds, cannot sell stocks the player doesn't own). Confirmation dialogs appear for major decisions like property purchases, allowing users to reconsider before committing to actions.

**Future Improvements:**  
We could add an undo function for recent actions, save game states automatically to prevent data loss, and provide clearer warnings when players are about to make potentially poor financial decisions.

---

## Principle 6: Low Physical Effort
**Current Features:**  
The game requires minimal physical input â€” primarily mouse clicks on clearly defined buttons and interface elements. Turn-based gameplay means users can take their time without pressure from real-time constraints.

**Future Improvements:**  
We could implement keyboard shortcuts, voice commands, and adjustable interface element sizes to reduce the precision required for interaction. Auto-save functionality would eliminate the need for manual saving actions.

---

## Principle 7: Size and Space for Approach and Use
**Current Features:**  
The interface is designed for standard computer screens with clearly separated interface elements. Buttons and clickable areas are reasonably sized for mouse interaction.

**Future Improvements:**  
We could implement responsive design for different screen sizes, adjustable UI scaling, and ensure the interface works well on tablets and larger displays. Touch-friendly button sizes and spacing could be implemented for touchscreen devices.

## Target Market
If we were to market this program, our primary target would be **casual gaming enthusiasts and families who enjoy strategic board games**. This includes parents looking for engaging games to play with children aged 10 and up, college students seeking entertainment during social gatherings, and adults who have fond memories of playing traditional Monopoly but want a more dynamic, modernized experience.  

The stock market feature particularly appeals to users interested in learning basic financial concepts in a low-stakes, gamified environment. Secondary markets would include educators who could use the game to teach economic principles, and digital board game communities who appreciate the convenience of not needing physical game pieces and the added features like real-time stock price integration.

## Demographic Accessibility Concerns
Our program may be less accessible to certain demographics, particularly older adults who may be less comfortable with computer interfaces and users with visual or motor impairments.  

The reliance on mouse-based interaction and visual color-coding creates barriers for users with mobility limitations or colorblindness. Additionally, the game assumes a certain level of computer literacy and familiarity with digital interfaces, which may exclude users from lower socioeconomic backgrounds who have had less exposure to computer technology.  

The stock market feature, while educational, might be intimidating or confusing to users without basic financial knowledge, potentially creating an educational barrier. Furthermore, the game currently lacks multilingual support, limiting accessibility for non-English speakers.  

To address these concerns, future development should prioritize implementing accessibility features such as screen reader compatibility, keyboard navigation, color-blind friendly design, and simplified interface options.
