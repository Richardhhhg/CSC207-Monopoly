# üí∏ CSC207-Monopoly
## Summary
This repository contains the code for the final project of CSC207 for Group 20. Our goal was to improve on the popular game monopoly by adding new features in an java implementation. We chose to include a features of being able to select from different character types, each with special traits and a stock market. This makes our implementation unique and fun compared to the original monopoly while also preserving key aspects such as the interaction with properties and other players.

## üõ≥Ô∏è How to Run
### Running without Use Real world Stock Data
1. Clone the repository to your local machine. This can be done either through Git Clone or by simpling downloading the zip from the dropdown menu opened by "Code":
   <img width="415" height="336" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f4154f4a-ffa7-4f20-b3fc-dfb766b65ee2" />
2. Run the file `Main` under src/main/app

This will create a stock market using sample stocks that are not built using real world data.

### Runnning with Real World Stock Data
1. Clone the Repository follow step 1 in installing without using real stock data.
2. Obtain an API key from Alpha Vantage here: https://www.alphavantage.co/
3. Add the API key to your environment variables under the name "API_KEY". This may vary for different IDE's. Here is the process in IntelliJ:  
   a. Click the dropdown menu next to the run button and click where it reads "Edit Configurations...":  
   <img width="315" height="167" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/832dfc84-52e4-4be0-958d-7d36b8990d2d" />  
   b. In the window that opens from clicking Edit Configurations, click on "Edit Configuration Templates...":  
   <img width="811" height="696" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/06ce82b6-3468-420f-a809-1dbe105b54d0" />
   c. Click Application in the window and enter your api key in the format "API_KEY=*your api key*" into the field "Environment Variables":
   <img width="798" height="692" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ed653480-59f9-4bf3-9699-f9da54f4715c" />

4. Go to the file `src/main/constants/Constants` and set the value for `USE_API` to `true`
5. Launch the game normally by running the file `main`.

This will build the game using stock market data sourced from real stocks. The stocks used in the game are set in the file `src/main/Resources/StockData/stock_names.json`.

### How can you Contribute
Our project is open to improvements whether it be with code or documentation.
To contribute:
1. Make a fork of the Repository  
   a. To do this simply click the fork button:
   <img width="513" height="62" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/081ba59f-228a-4ada-bb2f-012234f78dbe" />
2. Make your changes in the fork
3. Make a Pull Request from your Fork to the Main Repository

### üéØ Writing a Good Pull Request
In our pull requests we want a good non-technical summary of the changes implemented followed by more detailed breakdowns of how different files and modules were changed. See [PR #103](https://github.com/Richardhhhg/CSC207-Monopoly/pull/103) for a example. Expect your code to be reviewed by at least one contributor before it is approved.

### ‚úçÔ∏è Reviewing Contributions and Merging to Main
Aside from the overall game logic to still work without any major bugs, we expect that all code that is to be merged into main adheres to the principles of Clean Architecture and SOLID or modifies existing code to follow the principles. Thus when reviewing code, we will be looking for violations of Clean Architecture and SOLID and making necessary comments. Until these requested changes are fixed, the pull request will not be merged into main.
