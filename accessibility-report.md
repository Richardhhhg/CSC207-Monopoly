# Accessibility Report

## Principle 1: Equitable Use
Our game provides a consistent visual interface for all abstractPlayers, with clear color-coding for property ownership and abstractPlayer identification. Rules and mechanics are applied uniformly across the game, ensuring that no abstractPlayer receives an advantage through interface differences. This creates an equal playing experience for all participants regardless of ability.

In the future, we could add alternative input methods such as keyboard navigation for abstractPlayers who cannot use a mouse. Audio cues and screen reader compatibility, including text-to-speech announcements for game events and abstractPlayer statuses, would further expand accessibility for users with visual impairments.

## Principle 2: Flexibility in Use
The game allows abstractPlayers to choose from different character types with unique abilities, enabling a variety of strategies. The inclusion of a stock market mechanic offers an alternative path to victory beyond property ownership. Players can also sell properties and stocks at different points during their turn, which accommodates diverse play styles.

Future updates could include difficulty settings, customizable rules such as adjustable turn limits and starting money, and save/load functionality. These features would better accommodate abstractPlayers with different skill levels, available time, and cognitive processing speeds.

## Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive Use
The game uses familiar Monopoly conventions, including a traditional board layout, recognizable property colors, and clear button labels like “Roll Dice” and “End Turn.” Automated systems handle calculations such as rent payments and stock price updates, making the interface easy to use. Visual feedback from color-coded ownership and popup messages further helps guide abstractPlayer actions.

To improve accessibility, we could add tutorials, in-game help tooltips, and context-sensitive prompts for new abstractPlayers. Visual indicators of available actions at each stage of a turn would help reduce confusion for less experienced users.

## Principle 4: Perceptible Information
Information is presented through multiple channels, including color-coded tile ownership, text labels for interactive elements, and popup dialogs for key events like property purchases. Different tile types such as Go, Property, and Stock Market have distinct visual designs to help abstractPlayers quickly identify them. These cues work together to make the game’s state clear at all times.

In the future, we could add a high-contrast mode, adjustable font sizes, and audio announcements for major events. Presenting key information redundantly through visual and auditory channels would help ensure all abstractPlayers can access it regardless of sensory limitations.

---

## Principle 5: Tolerance for Error
The game automatically blocks invalid actions, such as attempting to buy a property without sufficient funds or selling stocks a abstractPlayer does not own. Confirmation dialogs are displayed before major irreversible decisions, such as purchasing property, giving abstractPlayers a chance to reconsider. These safeguards help prevent accidental mistakes.

We could expand these features with an undo function for recent actions and automatic saving to protect progress. Clearer warnings for potentially harmful financial decisions could also help less experienced abstractPlayers avoid unintended setbacks.

## Principle 6: Low Physical Effort
The game requires minimal physical effort, with most interactions consisting of single mouse clicks on large, clearly labeled buttons. Its turn-based nature allows abstractPlayers to proceed at their own pace without the pressure of real-time gameplay. This makes it accessible to users who may have limited stamina or slower reaction times.

Future improvements could include keyboard shortcuts, voice command functionality, and resizable interface elements to further reduce interaction effort. Auto-save features would also help minimize repetitive tasks.

---

## Principle 7: Size and Space for Approach and Use
The interface is designed for standard laptop screens, with well-spaced buttons and distinct interface sections. This ensures that interactive elements are easy to locate and select. The current layout is optimized for mouse input and works well for most desktop and laptop users.

Future work could include implementing responsive design to support tablets, large monitors, and other display sizes. Touch-friendly button sizes and layouts would make the game more usable on touchscreen devices.

## Target Market
If marketed, our program would primarily target casual gaming enthusiasts, families, and board game fans who enjoy strategic play. This includes parents looking for engaging games to play with children aged ten and older, college students seeking social entertainment, and adults nostalgic for traditional Monopoly but interested in a modernized version. The stock market mechanic also appeals to users who want to learn about basic economic principles in a low-pressure, gamified setting. Secondary audiences could include educators using the game for classroom demonstrations and online gaming communities interested in digital board game adaptations. The portability of the program makes it suitable for home, classroom, or casual group play.

## Demographic Accessibility Concerns
Our program may be less accessible to certain demographics, such as older adults unfamiliar with digital interfaces, users with visual or motor impairments, and those without access to a laptop or mouse. Color-coded indicators may be challenging for colorblind abstractPlayers, and the absence of multilingual support limits the game’s reach to non-English speakers. Additionally, the stock market feature, while educational, may intimidate abstractPlayers without prior financial knowledge, creating a barrier to full engagement. Players from lower socioeconomic backgrounds may face accessibility challenges if they lack the required hardware or internet connection. To address these issues, future updates could include screen reader compatibility, keyboard navigation, color-blind friendly palettes, multilingual support, and simplified game modes for abstractPlayers less familiar with financial systems.
